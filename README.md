# CaptainShotgunModes

## Description

This mod allows you to choose between 3 firing modes for the captain's shotgun: Normal, Auto and AutoCharge. With both auto modes you can just hold down the fire key and donÂ´t have to spam it.

You can cycle through the fire modes using number key '1'. The current mode is displayed above the primary skill icon.
